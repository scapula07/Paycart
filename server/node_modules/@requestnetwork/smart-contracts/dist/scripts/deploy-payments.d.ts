/**
 * Script ensuring all payment contracts are deployed and usable on a live chain.
 *
 * For a given chain, in the absence of `args.simulate` and `args.force`, the script is responsible for:
 * - Deploying contracts in the exact same sequence on every chain, to keep the same addresses
 * - Deploying only contracts which, according to the artifacts in `src/lib/artifacts`, are not yet deployed on the chain
 * - Doing the minimum required administration tasks (typically: handover administration to other wallets)
 * - Verifying the contract code of deployed contracts on the appropriate explorer, when relevant
 * - Switching to simulation mode if any deployment cannot be made (in order to keep the sequence)
 *
 * `args.force = true` to force deployments even if addresses are found in the artifacts (eg. on private network)
 * `args.simulate = true` to prevent deployments and contract verification
 *
